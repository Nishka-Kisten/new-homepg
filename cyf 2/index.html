          Hi, I’m Nishka.
          I'm a beginner in web developing and a recent commerce high school graduate. I’m from South Africa, Pietermaritzburg. I’m currently learning Basic JavaScript with Free Code Camp. So far I have learnt html and CSS.
        </p>

      <p>
        Art is my greatest hobby. Other hobbies of mine include reading books and painting/drawing. Art is my passion, so naturally, my free time is spent painting for friends. I have been working on color theory as it is a weak point for me. I always try to better my skills in areas that I am lacking.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Besides my hobbies, I'm interested in learning new things. Whether it is educational, or something cool or fun, new things pique my interest. I'm I enjoy learning new languages, I have been learning Afrikaans and Korean lately. My interest in the Korean language which started me on a journey of watching Korean dramas. That’s a whole new world.
        Something else that has recently piqued my interest is kickboxing. I have tried shadow-kickboxing which is extremely fun and helps me exercise.

      <h4>What excites me about tech</h4>
      <div>
        <span id="box-1"> What excites me most is that a tech career enables me to learn new things.
          I've heard that in this line of work, you constantly learn and better your skills.
          I am creative minded, and I have a great love for art.
          A career in tech enables me to be both creative and logical as I will be able to solve problems.
          What also excites me about having a career in tech, is the endless possibilities. Technology as always been constantly evolving.

        </span>
        <span id="box-2">
          I am curious about what I could create as I progress. Programming reminds me of art which, have I mentioned, <strong> I love</strong>
          There’s a lot of thought put into the process and when your ideas and the logic are mixed, the end results never cease to amaze me.
          When learning html and CSS, what I enjoyed most was putting that knowledge to use and seeing the outcome.
          I felt most excited watching my project come together.
          I am eager to have a future career in tech.
